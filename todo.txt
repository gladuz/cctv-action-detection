1. note that we can't use "pytorchvideo" because it needs python 3.7, 3.8.
we have to use python 3.6.9 due to the compatibility with tensorRT.

so i wrote a code for no-pytorchvideo version for rgb extraction but somehow
it doesn't work with my computer.

so i decided to use pytorchvideo version to extract rgb frames for training now,
and i will try to find a way to fix the problem later.

2. now i'm running extraction-rgb.py with pytorchvideo version on my
local computer. (ETA is around 15 hours. p.s. now it's Oct 8th 00:00 am)

3. can you code for extraction-flow.py? to extract flow frames from resized videos and
"SAVE" them in the processed_data folder?

later (ASAP), we can connect those two codes to make a single code for rgb and flow extraction.

and then, we can train the model with rgb and flow features (vector)
